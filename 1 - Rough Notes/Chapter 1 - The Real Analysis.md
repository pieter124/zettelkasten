# 1.1 - The irrationality of $\large \sqrt{2}$

A field is any set where addition and multiplication are well-defined operations that are commutative, associative, and obey the familiar distributivity property:
$\large a(b + c) =  ab + ac$
There must be an additive identity, and every element must have an additive inverse. There also must be a multiplicative identity, and multiplicative inverses must exist for all nonzero elements of the field.

The real numbers $\large\bf{R}$ are an extension to $\large\bf{Q}$ to fill in the gaps as e.g. handling cases like $\large\sqrt{2}$. Wherever there is a *gap*, a new *irrational* number is defined and placed into the ordering. The real numbers are the union of these irrational numbers together with the rational numbers.
