# **The Feynman Technique**

The Feynman Technique is a method of learning developed by Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman that focuses on understanding a concept by explaining it simply, as if teaching it to someone who knows nothing about the subject.

There are 4 key steps:
	 **Step 1:**
		 **Explain a topic to a child**.
			Choose a topic you want to understand and try explaining it as if you're talking to a child or someone who knows nothing about it. Either write it down, or speak it out loud.
	**Step 2:**
		**Identify knowledge gaps**:
			When explaining the concept, children are likely to ask "What is that?" or "Why is that?". General rule of thumb for comprehensive learning of a subject is asking what is it, why and why again.
	**Step 3:**
		**Simplify & clarify**:
			Rewrite any complex sections of your notes into simpler terms. Key note: make it simple but do not leave out important details.
	**Step 4:**
		**Review & repeat:**
			Go through the process again and again, until you can explain the concept simply and accurately.
